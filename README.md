# 🌱 Plant Monitoring System
> _A complete plant care ecosystem_

## Overview

The system is composed of four major components:

✅ Mobile App (Flutter)\
✅ AWS (Backend)\
✅ Hardware (ESP8266)\
✅ Database (Firebase)

## Features

Monitoring plant health is very important for their fast growth. In this busy world, people usually forget to water their plants which leads to bad growth and health of their plants. For ensuring complete development of plants it is necessary to develop proper surrounding conditions in which plants grow. We are now going to make a small Plant Monitoring system whose data will be displayed on the mobile screen. This system monitors the temperature, humidity, moisture levels in the soil and provides an opportunity to study the existing systems, along with their features and drawbacks.

Plant Monitoring System uses following components:

⚡️ESP8266 board as the main controller as well as remote connectivity\
⚡️DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to measure the temperature and the humidity of the environment\
⚡️Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor to detect the percentage of moisture present in the soil\
⚡️LDR for measuring the light flux
